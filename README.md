# Multiple-Linear-Regression-project-3
Objective
To build a Multiple Linear Regression Model using Python to accurately predict Profit of startups based on:

R&D Spend

Administration Spend

Marketing Spend

State

Solution
✅ Followed the complete Machine Learning Life Cycle:
 1️⃣ Data Collection
 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 4️⃣ Feature Engineering & Transformation
 5️⃣ Model Building & Evaluation
 6️⃣ Model Selection & Optimization

✅ Applied EDA using Seaborn with insightful visualizations.
✅ Performed necessary transformations to improve model accuracy.
✅ Created multiple models and compared their R² values.
✅ Selected the best model based on performance.
✅ Documented the entire process in a Word document and a PowerPoint Presentation.
✅ Uploaded code, graphs, datasets, and documents to this repo.

Business Impact

Insights Gathered
R&D Spend has the strongest positive correlation with Profit.

Marketing Spend contributes to Profit but has diminishing returns beyond a certain point.

Administration Spend has minimal direct impact on Profit in this dataset.

Certain states show slightly different Profit trends after adjusting for spending.
